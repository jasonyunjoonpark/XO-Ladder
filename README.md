XO Ladder allows fans of The Weeknd to see live rankings for all songs by The Weeknd. The ratings of each song are calculated using an Elo rating system (based on chess). This essentially gives a 'normalized' rating for every song relative to each other rather than the typical song charts based on number of streams which doesn't really mean much for the user.
